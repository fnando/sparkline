Generate SVG sparklines with JavaScript without any external dependency.

## Instalation

This lib is available as a NPM package. To install it, use the following command:

```
npm install @fnando/sparkline --save
```

If you're using Yarn (and you should):

```
yarn add @fnando/sparkline
```

You'll have to call `sparkline.sparkline(svg, values, options)` directly if you're loading the script without compiling your script (e.g. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)). Otherwise you can simply `import sparkline from "@fnando/sparkline";`.

## API

### `sparkline(svg, values, options = {})`

- `svg`: This is a `<svg>` reference that must contain three required attributes (`width`, `height`, and `stroke-width`). These attributes are used to calculate the drawing area.
- `values`: You can either provide an array of numbers or an array of objects that respond to `.value`. If you have a different data structure, see `options.fetch`.
- `options`: This optional argument allows you to further customize the sparkline. The available options are:
    - `fetch`: Use this function to return the value if you have a different data structure that's not natively supported by sparkline.
    - `onmousemove`: By setting this callback function, you'll enable the interactive mode (unless you set `options.interactive` to `false`). The callback signature is `callback(event, datapoint)`, where `datapoint` is an object containing the value, x/y coordinates, and the item index.
    - `onmouseout`: This callback function is called every time the mouse leaves the SVG area. You can use it to hide things like tooltips.
    - `spotRadius`: Set the spot radius. The default is `2`.
    - `cursorWidth`: Set the cursor width. The default is `2`.
    - `interactive`: When `true`, this enables the interactive mode. You don't have to set this option if you're providing a `onmousemove` callback.

## Usage

This is the minimum working example:

```html
<!-- width, height and stroke-width attributes must be defined on the target SVG -->
<svg class="sparkline" width="100" height="30" stroke-width="3"></svg>

<script>
  sparkline.sparkline(document.querySelector(".sparkline"), [1, 5, 2, 4, 8, 3, 7]);
</script>
```

You can change the colors by either setting the attributes directly to the SVG element or using CSS, like the following:

```css
/* just the line */
.sparkline {
  stroke: red;
  fill: none;
}

/* line with highlight area */
.sparkline {
  stroke: red;
  fill: rgba(255, 0, 0, .3);
}

/* change the spot color */
.sparkline--spot {
  stroke: blue;
  fill: blue;
}

/* change the cursor color */
.sparkline--cursor {
  stroke: orange;
}

/* style fill area and line colors using specific class name */
.sparkline--fill {
  fill: rgba(255, 0, 0, .3);
}

.sparkline--line {
  stroke: red;
}
```
